*DESCRIPTION*: This Java-based REST API client program demonstrates how to fetch and process real-time weather data using an HTTP GET request. It uses Java’s built-in networking classes such as `URL`, `HttpURLConnection`, `BufferedReader`, and `InputStreamReader`—without requiring any external libraries—making it simple and lightweight. The program retrieves JSON data from the Open-Meteo public API, reads the response stream, and manually extracts temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and timestamp information using string-based parsing methods. It can be executed on any Java-supported platform such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, or the command-line JDK. This type of task is widely applicable in real-world scenarios like weather dashboards, mobile or web applications, IoT devices, data monitoring systems, and any software that requires real-time API consumption and JSON handling.
